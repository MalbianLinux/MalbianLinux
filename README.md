## ☢ Malbian Linux ☣

Malbian Linux is a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution aimed towards Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering, created and maintained by [0xCambie](https://github.com/0xCambie).

The distributions run with custom scripts that would display information in a Tmux-session. What information? Useful information like Internet Conectivity, LAN IP Address, Target IP Address or Domain, VPN Connection status and Host connectivity status. The Xfce ISO consists of an Xfce Desktop Environment to provide a familiar user interface, while the DWM ISO runs with a Window Manager. They are both shipped with some general tools for Analyzing malware samples and simple system utilities in order to make the system more reliable and usable. 

I strongly recommend [installing](https://github.com/MalbianLinux/Malbian-ISOs) the Xfce version of Malbian since it's going to be less convoluted.

This distribution is 100% free to use and distribute. This project was made in order to contribute to the community while also helping those who are starting with MA & RE. Also, it's important to give back to the internet all the help and knowledge that it gave us. 

### Why debian?

Simply because the system needs to be robust and work without being updated constantly since during malware analysis sessions the system will be isolated from the net. A Debian based distro also helps us ship stable ISO images that will not decay so quickly over time this helps prevent the need of weekly updates making a little bit easier to maintain and keep clean.

### "Why would I use Malbian instead of any other distribution?"

Malbian was made as an alternative to Remnux which is based on Ubuntu. The good thing about Malbian is that it has ISOs to run live or install on disk at any time, while Remnux has OVA files which restricts the hypervisors where you can run it. 

Also, since Malbian is in an Alpha state, we are open to changes and modifications to best suit our needs. You can actually participate, suggest or ask for tools to be added into Malbian's images in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pJXMJ6KD) 

Finally, I'm not trying to convince or persuade anyone to use Malbian. I strongly believe that everyone should pick a Distribution that fits their needs, workflow and allows anyone to get the job done. What I'm trying to do is build a distribution with qualities that would allow a simple, fast and safe way to analyze malware samples.
